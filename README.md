# Image-Super-Resolution-with-SRCNN-SRGAN

The original paper is Learning a Deep Convolutional Network for Image Super-Resolution : [Click Here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7115171)

# Objectives

Implemented super resolution convolutional neural networks (SRCNN) and applied super resolution to input images.


# This Project

1. Use the PSNR, MSE, and SSIM image quality metrics

2. Process images using OpenCV

3. Convert between the RGB, BGR, and YCrCb color spaces

4. Build SRCNN deep neural network architecture in Keras

5. Deploy and evaluate the SRCNN network
